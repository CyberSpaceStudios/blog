<h1>Chapter 1: Introduction</h1>
<p>On any fourm for microcontrollers, there is always going to be a post asking if they can run Linux on their Microcontroller.</p>
<h3>Their Answer? Laughter.</h3>
<p>Raspberry Pi's RP2040 microcontroller is no exception.</p>

<h1>Chapter 2: History</h1>
<p>On Feb 23rd, 2023, an electronics engineering student, who goes by the name Vlad TomoiagÄƒ, made the gtihub repo <a href="https://github.com/tvlad1234/pico-rv32ima">pico-rv32ima</a> which has ammased over 150 starts on github at the time of writing.</p>
<p>But we need to go a futher back to understand.</p>
<br>
<p>On Oct 28, 2022, CNLohr created a repo for his new project, Mini-RV32IMA.</p>
<p>He started the project as a way of learning more about the RISC-V architecture and had a goal of running linux on it which he successfully compleated on Nov 27, 2022</p>
<p>He mentions that it is a RISC-V core with the extensions "(I)nteger", "(M)ultiplication and Division" and "(A)tomic Instructions". And importantly, it doesn't use any dependencies, not even libc. Only pure C.</p>

<p>Now we can come back into the present.</p>
