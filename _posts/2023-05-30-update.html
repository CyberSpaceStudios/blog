<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>Welcome to the blog of CyberSpaceStudios!</p>

<p>So, here is an update: </p>
<p>I got everything up and running on github pages. The only thing that isn't working is the contact section and the about us.<p>
  
<h2 class="section-heading">Current Problems</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The contact section says there is an problem when there isn't</li>
  <li>The 'About Us' section has the default data</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="section-heading">What works</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Everything else</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="section-heading">Future of the Blog</h2>
<p>The blog is going to be used to talk about projects happening in CyberSpaceStudios. There will be other Cyber-related things here on this blog also.</p>
<p>There are no fixed plans for the blog. The blog still needs to be setup fully. But, for now, that's all I got to say.</p>
